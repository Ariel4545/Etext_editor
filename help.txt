Marking:
Egon Text Editor works quite differently from other text editing programs,
something that can work differently between each character you will choose to change.
The simplest way to change something text related is by marking it.
But if you will not mark something,
Egon Text Editor will select automatically for you what it will affect depending on what tool you're willing to use:
Bold, Italics, underline, text color & text to speech - will choose the entire file
Align right, Align center, Align left - will select the line you're on

Import non-text file:
Egon-Text-Editor will let you import some nontext file types to your text file.
It works by selecting to file type in the file menu and then selecting the file you want (with the same type),
and then it will convert it to text and append it to where you are in the Text file.

File bar & Status bar:
The File bar & Status bar are two labels at the bottom of the program,
They notify you about two things:
Status bar - number of words & characters that the file has.
File bar - file name, date and time of saving the file, file state, etc.
You can turn off these labels by using Settings.
